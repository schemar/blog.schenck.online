description: I looked into quil to generate images with clojure. I present some of the outcomes.
---

Last year, around the same time, I looked into [quil](http://www.quil.info/) to generate images with [clojure](https://clojure.org/). You can find the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/schemar/generative). As you can see there, I have no experience with clojure and thus the code is not very readable.

Anyways, I generated some images with random components. The ones I like the most are the "Floating Triangles".

Floating Triangles
For the "Breaking Triangles" it depends extremely on the colors, I think. I prefer two colors over three.

Breaking Triangles
Below are the earliest attempts. I was first trying to figure out how clojure works and then how quil works.

Broken Circle
A circle with differently (but similarly) colored segments was my first sketch.
