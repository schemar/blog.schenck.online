After a long time, I tried [processing](https://processing.org/) again. The last time I used processing was many years ago when we did some simple visualizations for a few DJ sets. And even though there is this cool new kid on the block - [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - I decided to go with what I somewhat know and used the conventional processing tool. Both, processing and p5.js, are maintained by the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/). [This is their GitHub account](https://github.com/processing).

I wanted to create a mosaic-like color effect on architectural images. I created two iterations. The first one only changes the colors randomly. The second iteration (`v2`) also takes the original pixel coordinates randomly from another mosaic part, which results in rearranged and potentially duplicate mosaic parts.

Below, you can see the results of my first endeavor. While Hue, Saturation, and Brightness change are random per mosaic part, I set minimum values for saturation and brightness to guarantee somewhat light pictures. You can find the code that generated all the images below in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/schemar/generative) under the `processing` folder.
